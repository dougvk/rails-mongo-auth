Commit 66f2a599f7f6f25a2ddb68f1b6f25cbd277396d9 has just the User model with
authentication/sessions working with MongoDB. Anything after that has the User,
if he specifies a URL, get autotagged based on the categories associated with
his site on http://www.dmoz.org, the human-curated categorization site.

Future updates:

1) Make the user discoverable based on his tags, by leveraging ThriftDB for a 
simple, powerful search tool.

2) Auto-updating, navigational tag cloud for visual search.
